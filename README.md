(**NOTE:** View a rendered version of this file in VS Code with `ctrl-shift-v` or `cmd-shift-v`)

&nbsp;
## Background

In this assignment, you will use [Twitter's Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) to add pre-built CSS and JavaScript components to your website. This assignment is designed to help you practice using a CSS framework to build responsive, styled layouts more efficiently.

&nbsp;
## Setup

Create a git repository titled `m11-hw11-lastname-firstname` and clone the repo to your computer. Copy the `index.html` file from the `unsolved` folder into the root directory of your repository folder.

&nbsp;
## Instructions

1. Create a single webpage about yourself and your hobbies, interests, and career goals using Bootstrap. Please keep all of the content professional and appropriate for the academic setting. To receive full-credit, you must:
    1. Include a [mobile-responsive navbar component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/).
        * Your navbar component's menu must open and close on mobile screens. This functionality comes pre-built into the component example code in the documentation. To preserve this functionality, avoid changing any `data-` or `id` attributes when modifying the component for your site. 
    1. Use the [Bootstrap responsive grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) to create columns as necessary for your page.
        * [Your columns MUST be responsive](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#responsive-classes) on mobile devices.
    1. Use [Bootstrap's spacing utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/) for setting margin and padding as necessary.
    1. Use two other Bootstrap components such as [cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) or [buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/)
        * You MUST notate which components you used in the README for this assignment.

You may use **minimal** amounts of your own CSS as necessary to change details like fonts and colors to stylize your site to your liking. Avoid using custom CSS as much as possible.

&nbsp;
## Deployment

Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must:

1. Ensure your repository has an `index.html` file in the root directory.
1. Navigate to the `settings` section of the repository.
1. Click on `pages` in the left navigation menu.
1. Under `source` click the dropdown and select your `master` or `main` branch.
1. Click `save`.

Your site should be deployed to `<your github username>.github.io/<your repository name>` in 5.30 minutes.

&nbsp;
## Submission

Please submit both a link to your repository and a link to the live site. Also please include any comments on stumbling blocks or difficulties encountered while completing the assignment.
